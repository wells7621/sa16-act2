<h3>About my work</h3>

<p>I am passionate about pursuing projects that can make a difference and being creative through technology with web development. My recent studies in human-computer interaction have helped me in my ongoing role, where Iâ€™m honing my web development and UI/UX skills.</p>

<h3>UOM Rewards</h3>

<h5>Project Overview:</h5>
<p>This project aimed to address the challenge many students face in balancing their academic responsibilities, social life, and other commitments. We identified that this struggle often hinders students' ability to socialize and form meaningful connections on campus.</p>

<h5>My Role:</h5>
<p>I was mainly the designer for this app, since this was only a conceptual project. I primarly focused on creating the user interface (UI) for the UOM Rewards app. I collaborated with the team to design the task screens, reward screens, and navigation menu, as well as improving the overall app design.</p>

<h5>Design Process</h5>
<p>Our design process began with conducting interviews to gather evidence for the problem we were addressing. From there, we developed three personas representing different user profiles and created storyboards based on their needs and behaviors. Through a speed-date session, we validated our ideas and found that the UOM Rewards concept resonated strongly with our target audience.</p>

<h5>Project Desctiption</h5>
<p>UOM Rewards is an app designed to incentivize and assist students in managing their tasks and organizing their daily lives. The app generates personalized schedules based on users' tasks, and as they complete tasks, their progress bar fills up, unlocking rewards upon reaching 100%. The goal of the app is to empower students to better manage their time, ultimately enhancing their college experience and facilitating connections.</p>

<h5>Design Iterations</h5>
<p>Our design iterations involved starting with low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq and conducting a usability acceptance review (UAR) with other teams to identify potential issues. Feedback from the UAR highlighted concerns such as users' lack of understanding of certain elements, such as checkboxes, and the absence of confirmation after redeeming a reward. To address these issues, we incorporated tooltips to provide guidance and added a confirmation page to ensure users are informed when they redeem a reward.</p>
